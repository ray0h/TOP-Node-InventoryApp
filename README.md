# Backend Node Inventory App

Made using [express application generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) and features:
- Pug for page views
- Mongoose/MongoDB Atlas for database

App is based on [Mozilla Express tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) and originated from this The Odin Project [Node.JS assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/inventory-application)

The app creates a grocery store inventory with routes for categories/locations.
